# algorithm-practice

Daily algorithm practice with C++ implementation, questions are mainly taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/) and [nowcoder (牛客)](https://www.nowcoder.com/exam/oj?page=1&tab=%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E7%AF%87&topicId=295). 
Most of the solutions are based on or adapted from this [link (代码随想录)](https://programmercarl.com/) 

Please note that I am using Chinese for the comments & explanations in the solutions.

## Updates (on 15/11/2023) 

(I will update each question's link here when I go through them for the second round in the near future.)
- Link List (链表) The implementation code of the link list is taken from [here](https://blog.csdn.net/ccblogger/article/details/81176338).
- Recursion and traversal (递归与回溯)
- Hash (哈希)
- Array, sliding window, search, and double pointers (数组，滑动窗口，查找以及双指针法)
- Greedy (贪心算法)
- String (字符串)
- Queue and stack (队列和栈)
- Monotonic stack (单调栈)
- Binary tree (二叉树)
- Dynamic programming (动态规划)
- DFS and BFS (图论-深度优先和广度优先)
