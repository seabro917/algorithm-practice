# algorithm-practice

Daily algorithm practice with C++ implementation, questions are mainly taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/) and [nowcoder (牛客)](https://www.nowcoder.com/exam/oj?page=1&tab=%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E7%AF%87&topicId=295). 
Part of the solutions are based on or adapted from this [link (代码随想录)](https://programmercarl.com/) 

Please note that I am using Chinese for the comments & explanations in the solutions.
