# algorithm-practice

Daily algorithm practice with C++ implementation, questions are mainly taken from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.cn/) and [nowcoder (牛客)](https://www.nowcoder.com/exam/oj?page=1&tab=%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95%E7%AF%87&topicId=295). 
Most of the solutions are based on or adapted from this [link (代码随想录)](https://programmercarl.com/) 

Please note that I am using Chinese for the comments & explanations in the solutions.

## Updates (on 17/07/2023) 

(I will update each question's link here when I go through them for the second round in the near future.)

- Recursion (回溯)
- Hash (哈希)
- Array, search, and double pointers (数组，查找以及双指针法)
